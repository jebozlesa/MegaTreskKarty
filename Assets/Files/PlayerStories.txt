#"...in the year 30 AD, in the small village of Cana in present-day Israel, a wedding took place to which Jesus Christ and his disciples were invited. During the celebrations, the guests began to worry that there was a serious shortage of wine in their supplies.
Understanding their concerns and not wanting to spoil the festive atmosphere, Jesus decided to help. He approached the containers filled with water and prayed for their transformation. When the guests tasted the water, they found that it had miraculously turned into excellent wine, and the wedding feast could continue..."

#Hitler
#"...in the early 1930s, in a small town in Germany, Adolf Hitler was gaining popularity with his powerful speeches and promises of a brighter future for the German people. As the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), he was determined to rebuild the country's economy and military power after the humiliating defeat in World War I.
One day, during a rally, a man in the crowd threw a tomato at Hitler, causing a commotion among the spectators. Instead of losing his temper, Hitler calmly picked up the tomato and said, "This is a symbol of the rotting system we will replace with a stronger, more prosperous Germany."
Within a few years, Hitler would become the Chancellor of Germany, leading the nation into the dark and tragic events of World War II and the Holocaust."
